# Relative Sink-Strenght

## Goal:
- Compute partitioning factors with the relative sink-strength principle.

## Example:
- An example is given in file ![alt text](https://github.com/Murilodsv/relative_ss/blob/master/relative_ss_example.R)
- At this repo you will find an example with an arbitrary crop composed by 3 organs: 1 root, 1 leaf, 1 stem
- We also hypothesize a scenario where water stress can alter the crop's sink strength and each organs has its sensitivity
